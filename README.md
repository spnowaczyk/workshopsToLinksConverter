# How to preprocess .xlsx file.
It is important to know, that the input for this program should be preprocessed. Here's an instruction:
1. First column should contain the name of workshop, and second the link.
2. If you don't want to add the link to any workshop, and instead print "check later" message, in the second column wite only '&'.
3. If you want to provide the name of the day as a header, in first colum write the '@' sign followed by name of day, and in second '*'.
4. Download or save the file as .csv
5. Use online tool like https://onlinetools.com/csv/change-csv-delimiter to set the delimeter to ';' instead of ',', and delete quote marks (in some cases it may not be necessery, but it is good to do it anyways).
6. If the tool returns .csv, simply change it to .txt or simply open it in notepad and save it as .txt file.
7. Paste into the folder with .txt file
